Workflow:

1. Clone repo
2. Before starting to work on a new feature, make sure that the files on your local machine are up-to date when comparing it to the master. (pull if your files are behind).
4. Create the branch with the name of the feature you are currently working on.
5. After work is complete, create a pull request from your branch to the master. Create a ticket on trello that your work is awaiting review. If there is any feedback, you will be notified. Otherwise, your work will be merged to master.
